Act as a Senior Lead Frontend Architect to design and implement a production-grade e-commerce platform named “Mart – For You” using React and Tailwind CSS. The goal is to deliver a high-performance, maintainable, and accessible shopping experience that functions as a real-world application.Begin by defining a scalable, feature-based directory structure that clearly separates UI components, core logic, state providers, hooks, and mock data. The application should be architected around a robust React Context API setup that serves as the single source of truth for global state, including cart management, user profile data, theme preferences, and notifications. All key user interactions must persist across browser sessions using localStorage synchronization through custom hooks. Include an Error Boundary strategy to prevent application-wide failures and provide a user-friendly fallback experience. Design a modern, responsive interface using Tailwind CSS with support for light and dark themes, consistent typography, accessible interactions, and polished visual hierarchy across mobile, tablet, and desktop layouts.

Implement a comprehensive product catalog with multiple categories, real-time search, category-based filtering, special offers views, and dynamic product counts. Product presentation should use responsive grids, interactive cards, and smooth animations with clear feedback for cart actions.The shopping cart and checkout flow should reflect real-world behavior, including quantity management, item removal, shipping options, real-time pricing calculations, loading states, and order confirmation feedback. Notifications should be handled through a reusable toast system supporting multiple message types and animations.Include user profile functionality that allows viewing and editing personal information with proper validation, save and cancel workflows, and success or error feedback. Navigation elements such as the header and footer should integrate search, cart access, profile controls, and theme toggling to ensure a cohesive user experience.Use React Router for multi-page navigation and implement code-splitting and lazy loading for route-level components to optimize performance. Follow frontend best practices including clear component documentation, consistent naming conventions, separation of concerns, and performance optimizations using memoization where appropriate.The final result should be a polished, production-quality e-commerce application suitable for deployment or use as a strong portfolio project.
