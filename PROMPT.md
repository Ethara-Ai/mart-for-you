Act as a Senior Lead Frontend Architect to build a production-grade e-commerce platform named “Mart – For You” using React and Tailwind CSS. Create a complete, real-world shopping application that is high-performance, maintainable, accessible, and suitable for deployment or portfolio use.

The platform must include a multi-page shopping experience with a landing page, product listing pages, a dedicated offers section, a shopping cart, a checkout flow, a user profile page, and a custom not-found page. The application should support a comprehensive product catalog with multiple categories, real-time search, category-based filtering, special offers, and dynamic product counts. Products must be displayed in a responsive grid with interactive cards and clear feedback for user actions.

The shopping cart must allow users to add and remove items, adjust quantities, select shipping options, view real-time pricing totals, and complete a simulated checkout with order confirmation. User profile functionality must allow viewing and editing personal information with validation, save and cancel behavior, and persistent data across sessions.

The application must support light and dark themes, persistent user preferences, and a notification system that provides feedback for actions such as cart updates, profile changes, and checkout events. The interface must be fully responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop, include smooth animations, and follow accessibility best practices.

All user interactions, such as cart contents, profile data, and theme preferences, must persist across browser sessions. The final result should be a polished, production-quality e-commerce application that behaves like a real product, without backend services, authentication systems, or payment integrations.
